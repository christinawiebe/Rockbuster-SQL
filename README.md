# Rockbuster-SQL
Analysis of a fictional movie rental company's data using SQL.

## Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Recently, the company has been facing competition from streaming services and the store count is down to only two.

## Key Questions
- What is the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
- Which movies/genres contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
